#ðŸš— Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

##ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world pricing engine for 14 urban parking lots using real-time data. The objective is to improve parking lot utilization by dynamically adjusting prices based on real-time demand indicators such as occupancy, queue length, traffic conditions, special events, and vehicle types.

The pricing engine is developed in three stages:

ðŸ”¹ Model 1: Baseline Linear Model
A simple linear pricing formula based on occupancy rate.

ðŸ”¹ Model 2: Demand-Based Model
A more intelligent model using multiple features to compute a demand score and adjust prices accordingly.

The solution processes data in real-time using Pathway and visualizes price trends using Bokeh to ensure smooth, explainable price adjustments.
